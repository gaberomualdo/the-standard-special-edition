                    The virus was initially contained within animals, but was transmitted to humans at a meat and fish market in Wuhan. 
                    
                    The transferral of the virus created an outbreak that has infected over 80,000 people thus far and killed nearly 3000 at the time of writing. 
                    
                    As a coronavirus, the symptoms of the disease resemble that of a flu, including a fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat and breathing problems, according to the NHS. 
                    
                    Ellie Lowe (’22) said that the spread of the disease is a concerning development.
                    
                    “Obviously it’s a very imminent danger,” she said. “Being Chinese, seeing China quarantined and no flights are going there, it’s quite hard.”
                    
                    The spread of the disease has incited global alarm over the fear of the disease extending further.`

                In a statement by AMIS Director Executive Director Keith Montgomery, he explained the reasoning for the cancellation of the music trips.
                
                “It is necessary to cancel both the High School Honor Choir Festival in Oman and the High School Honor Band and Orchestra Festival in Dubai. The Oman festival cannot go on because of an expanding quarantine-upon-arrival policy of which we cannot predict the scope. Both the Oman Ministry of Health and the American International School of Muscat have asked AMIS to cancel this festival. Although there is currently no similar quarantine practice in place in the United Arab Emirates, we have had so many schools withdraw from the Dubai festival that the number of remaining participants is negligible.”`

                Director of Athletics and Chairman of the ISST organization John Farmer said that after February Break, he asked each participating member of the ISST organization to update him on their stance regarding the coronavirus.
                
                Farmer said that he wanted to make sure the participating schools were taking the virus seriously, considering ASL is planning to host the Rugby 7s ISST tournament in March. 
                
                After the initial contact, Farmer said he decided, as ISST chair, to request a clear stance from all member schools on their perspective on international travel by March 3. A decision made regarding all of the ISSTs would be made on March 5. `

                The trips were originally scheduled to occur March 23-26, with several trips planned to visit continental Europe. However, the amount of coronavirus cases in Italy specifically has surged to over 400 cases, causing the virus to spread to other European countries and increasing the risk of an epidemic in Europe.
                
                Head of School Robin Appleby said that the decision to cancel the trips was made in order to prioritize students’ health and safety. She said the school looked at the rapidly developing changes across Europe and realizes that, since the trips are four and a half days long, conditions could worsen during that time.
                
                “We might face the risk of not being able to get a group back or having a group have to go into isolation,” she said. “When you combine that with the risk of someone becoming ill and the responsibility and stress that could create for our employees … we just decided it wasn’t in anybody’s best interest to go ahead at this time.”`

                “It’s a large scale event that usually attracts a couple thousand people, not just from ASL but also from outside ASL with family friends and guests,” she said. “People are close together in the event, it’s crowded and it’s a food-based event, very often people are picking things up with their fingers.”
                
                Due to the risk of the virus potentially spreading at the event, the administration decided that it was imprudent to go ahead with the Global Festival as originally planned.
                
                “We just decided that at a time when there was a higher risk to public health, that this is probably not the ideal time to do it,” she said.

                previewText: `As the ongoing coronavirus outbreak has all but dominated public discourse since its worldwide emergence in January, the true extent of the threat it poses has become direly more clear. An analysis conducted by the Economist suggests that  “25-70% of an infected country’s population” could become infected if infections are not quickly isolated. Recent cases in the United States point to worrying signs that people are still at risk of infection despite not having any travel-links to infected countries. And, as was discovered in Italy, sudden influxes in patients can overwhelm unprepared governments.
                
                The suppression of this virus is dependent upon domestic healthcare systems functioning to protect and treat its citizens, but that in itself is partially dependent on global cooperation. In order to limit its further spread and resulting death, countries must play an active role within the international community. 

                Firstly, the World Health Organization (WHO) must be granted full access to each and every country that has cases of COVID-19. Being the lead international body on global health, having access to the world’s top minds in medicine, as well as nearly limitless resources, it’s importance in the global response to coronavirus should not be understated.`
